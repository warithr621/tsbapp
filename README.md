# TSB App

This serves as an application hosted directly on the [TSB Website](https://www.texassciencebowl.com/) in order to edit packets every year. This *will* include
- Login page to secure all problem-writing
- A page to upload questions, allowing for storage in a consistent format
- Page to view questions, either by subject or by round
- The ability to export all questions in a round in a LaTeX PDF, allowing for easy packet generation
- An easy password-protected reset switch, so that questions can be completely cleared for the next year
