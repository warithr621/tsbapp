# Things to do before deployment
- [x] Add distinction in question display between tossup and bonus
- [ ] Add LaTeX support
  - [x] LaTeX previews should show when putting questions in the upload
  - [ ] Questions that are seen in the View page should automatically be rendered in LaTeX in similar fashion
- [ ] Come up with a way to edit questions after being written, such as clicking the question and getting the same platform as the upload page
- [ ] Change the subject viewing platform to mimic the Google Sheets (sorted by round and position within round) for easy viewing
  - One thought could be to almost implement Sheets itself? We could make each subject have its own table, and you would click a cell to add the question (and then be able to edit them to move it around as necessary)
- [ ] Find an efficient way to pair up tossups with their respective bonuses
- [ ] Implement ordering within a subject, so that "easier" questions can be set earlier in the packet
- [ ] Use Michael's TeX template (`samplepacket/` directory) from last year to be able to export both the TeX and PDF version of packets from the Viewing page
- [x] Make the display of the website more aesthetically pleasing (Tailwind?)
- [ ] Make sure that people on the website can't accidentally view the question platform without the password (i.e. ensure password protection is foolproof)
  - This also includes actually implementing secure passwords
- [ ] Figure out how to actually deploy on the website, and connect to MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Look into potential costs, and minimize as much as possible
