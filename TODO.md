# Things to do before deployment
- [x] Make the display of the website more aesthetically pleasing (Tailwind?)
- [x] Add distinction in question display between tossup and bonus
- [x] Add LaTeX support
  - [x] LaTeX previews should show when putting questions in the upload
  - [x] Questions that are seen in the View page should automatically be rendered in LaTeX in similar fashion
- [ ] Come up with a question-editing platform similar to our current Google Sheets
  - [ ] Modify question upload display so you first choose subject, and then are redirected to a spreadsheet (tabled) platform sorted by round
  - [ ] Allow for empty cells to be clicked on to upload a new question (with subject + round + TU/B already pre-selected)
  - [ ] Allow for non-empty cells to be clicked on to edit a current question (including delete one)
  - [ ] Ensure that all questions are ordered relative to each other, and is reflected in the View display
  - [ ] Make sure TU/B pairs are actually connected to each other
  - [ ] Come up with a way to allow for reorganizing questions (e.g. you should be able to change a question to be the 2nd in the row, and all others will shift accordingly)
    - Note: Look into whether it's more optimal to make the cell swap with the previous inhabitant, or shift everything relatively
- [ ] Use Michael's TeX template (`samplepacket/` directory) from last year to be able to export both the TeX and PDF version of packets from the Viewing page
- [x] Make sure that people on the website can't accidentally view the question platform without the password (i.e. ensure password protection is foolproof and **not** client-side)
- [ ] Figure out how to actually deploy on the website, and connect to MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Look into potential costs, and minimize as much as possible
