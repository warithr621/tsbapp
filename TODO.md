# TODO
- [x] Add pronunciation guide support (should be able to put something like `What is a monkey [munk-kee]` and have the `\pron{}` render on the packet template)
- [ ] I wanna see if there's a way to add CSV support. The tsbapp may be weird with multiple people working at the same time, so it could be easier to work on Sheets and upload the CSV onto the page
    - This would force the Sheets to be formatted in a specific manner, which is like not that big of a deal (can also template the Sheets as needed to make it easier for people).
    - [x] Once uploaded, there should be a "preview" selection to view all the question formatting and make sure everything is good, and be able to easily tweak as necessary.
    - [ ] The app should probably have some kind of warning system in case it tries to override a question that exists.
